# jscom-mini-services

A collection of tiny microservices powering the API for my personal website. This repository is the home for the first mini-serviceâ€”a simple endpoint to return the client's IP address, similar to whatismyip.com. Expect additional mini-services in the future!

## Current Services

- **IP Service:** Returns the requestor's IP address when invoked via API Gateway. Perfect for quickly checking your external IP or integrating with other tools.

## Future Services

More microservices are on the way, each designed to address a specific need while maintaining a lightweight, easily maintainable codebase.
